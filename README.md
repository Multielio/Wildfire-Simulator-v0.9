# Wildfire-Simulator

![alt text](https://github.com/Multielio/Wildfire-Simulator/blob/master/img.png)

Simulator based on the real physical phenomenons acting in a wildfire, deals with wind, topography (with few changes), heat capacities..an more.
It took me 1 year to build it.


**It is mainly based on the following papers**
- Mohamed Drissi / Modeling the spreading of large-scale wildland fires 
- J.K.Adou,  A.D.V.Broub, B.Porterie / Modeling wildland fire propagation using a semi-physical network model / Case Studies in Fire Safety 4 (2015) 11–18 

**Main assumptions**

- No conduction
- No screening effect
- Flames are cylinders

**Required libraries**
- Matplolib
- Numpy
- Scipy
- tqdm


**How it works**
- The simulation start
- The simulator (simulator.py) loads the precalculated data generated by multitaskingallhateurs.py 

- At each update {
1. The simulator makes a energetic balance for each cell 
2. The simulator determines the next state of each cell based on the energetic balance.
3. The simulator prepare data for the next update of the simulator.
}

Frequently the simulator return a image of the simulation.



**Usage**


**Warning this section may be incorrect due to recent changes, you can however quickstart the simulator by launching test.py**
1. First, you have to precalculate radiation with multitaskingallhauteur.py.
To do that choose the paramaters (line 276-294) of the prepacalculator. And start the programm.
Warning even if you have a good machine it can take a few hours even for simple paramaters.
To accelerate the calculus this script has been created to be able to use all cores of a CPU. So to accelerate the calculs you shoulf replace process=6 by the amount of cores available.
2. You should see files in the folder where multitaskingallhauteur.py is. These files are the precalculus files. We will import them.
3. Now in feu_reel9.py, replace the path (line 75) to the precalculed files and use the same parameters as in the precalculus (cell radius, fuel cell high, ...).
4. Fill the simulator with the other paramaters(line 23-75) if you want (all parameters have already a value by default) simulator.
5. You are ready to start the simulation, you can start it with less than 5 lines of code, as the test_grille() function does.
6. The result of the simulation will appear in a folder called « stockage »
